# Blog application on the react framework.

This project was bootstrapped with the Codesandbox.io online - IDE.

## Technology stack - React + Redux + React-router + Bootstrap + some npm react Libraries.

Throughout this project, I have been learning how the
framework works. I am already familiar with hooks and states
thanks to the freecodecamp learning center. In this project I
used the Redux react state management tool for the first time.
Find out some of the advantages and disadvantages of thistool.
I also learned about custom hooks and how to use scripts
in react applications. The project was created on a local
machine. I used create-react-tool to create it.
It was deployed using the npm manager.

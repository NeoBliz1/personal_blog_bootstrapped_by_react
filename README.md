# Blog application based on react.

This project was bootstrapped with the Codesandbox.io online - IDE.

## Technology stack - React + Redux + React-router + Bootstrap + some npm react Libraries.


Throughout the project, I've been learning how the framework works. I am already familiar with hooks and states, thanks to the freecodecamp learning center. In this project, I used the Redux react state management tool for the first time. I learned about some of the advantages and disadvantages of this tool. I also learned about custom hooks and how to use scripts in react applications. The project was created on a local machine. I used create-react-tool to create it. It was deployed using the npm manager.
